## Project 
This p5.js project is inspired by retro pokemon games where the avatar is seen looking through grass, it calles to a pokemon API https://pokeapi.co/, that list through pokemon names finds their sprite image and displays them in a random order using object orientated programming. It them generates grass on top which the user can looking through and see different types of pokemon. 

## Known Issues
The browser will run out of memory after a short period of time, I would like to add a feature similiar to wheres waldo where the user will have to search for a specific pokemon.
